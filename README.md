# Course Scheduling Project
Course scheduling is a highly constrained satisfaction problem. The project aims to find a consistent schedule given a number of university courses subject to multiple constraints. A consistent schedule maps courses to a fixed number of rooms and timeslots where each course is assigned an instructor in a conflict-free manner.
